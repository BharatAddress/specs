# DIGIPIN Integration

Use India Post DIGIPIN as the spatial anchor for entrance points.

Workflow:
1. Capture the main entrance point (gate/lobby) for each building.
2. Snap to the official DIGIPIN cell using the public portal.
3. Record the value in `primary_digipin`; optional service access in `secondary_digipin`.
