# LGD and ULB Codes

Every record is keyed to an authoritative ULB LGD code (`ulb_lgd`) and optionally a `ward_id`.

Pointers:
- LGD Portal: https://lgdirectory.gov.in/
- Villages with PIN (crosswalks): https://www.data.gov.in/resource/local-government-directory-lgd-villages-pin-codes

Use the crosswalk to validate that `pin` belongs to the ULB or its wards.
